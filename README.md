Project Overview

This project focused on implementing a deep Q-learning intelligent agent to solve a treasure hunt game. The provided starter code included the TreasureMaze.py class, which represented the maze environment, and the GameExperience.py class, which handled memory of past episodes for experience replay. Additionally, the Jupyter notebook contained setup code for the maze, helper functions for visualization, and a skeleton of the deep Q-learning model. My main task was to complete the unfinished sections of the notebook — specifically, the implementation of the deep Q-learning algorithm. This included defining the neural network, training loop, reward structure, and updating the agent’s decision-making process. The result was a working agent (the pirate) that could learn an optimal path to the treasure.

Connecting to Computer Science

This project reflects a central responsibility of computer scientists: solving complex problems using computational methods. Computer scientists design algorithms, create models, and build systems that improve efficiency and decision-making in various domains, from games to real-world navigation systems. The application of reinforcement learning here connects to broader areas in computer science, including artificial intelligence, robotics, and optimization. These skills are significant because they directly impact how technology can adapt to dynamic, uncertain environments — a crucial need in industries ranging from healthcare to autonomous vehicles.

Approaching Problems as a Computer Scientist

When approaching a problem as a computer scientist, I begin by breaking it down into smaller, manageable components. For this project, that meant first understanding the environment (TreasureMaze), then learning how the memory storage (GameExperience) worked, and finally integrating these pieces into a reinforcement learning pipeline. My approach was iterative: I tested the code in small steps, debugged errors, and refined the logic to improve the agent’s performance. This process mirrors the larger scientific method — analyze the problem, propose a solution, experiment, and refine based on results.

Ethical Responsibilities

Working with intelligent systems also raises ethical responsibilities. As a computer scientist, I must ensure that the algorithms I create are transparent, reliable, and safe for end users. For example, in real-world reinforcement learning applications such as autonomous driving, an error in training or bias in the model could have serious consequences. My responsibility is to minimize risks, avoid misuse of data, and design systems that serve both the organization and the end users fairly. This means not only building efficient models but also considering long-term implications such as privacy, security, and societal impact.
